# iSeq
iSeq: software for analysis and interpretation of DSB-Sequencing data. 
 This page provides information and guidelines on how to download, install and use Instant Sequencing (iSeq), the software suite dedicated to the analysis and interpretation of DSB-sequencing data (such as BLESS). Please refer to the Tutorial section for more information. 
 
Tutorial on how to use iSeq software to reproduce our results from Crosetto et al, Nature Methods 10, 361â€“365 (2013) is coming soon.
This section describes how to download the iSeq suite of software. We also explain how to install hygestat_BLESS, the main component of iSeq.
The Tutorial section contains information on how to install and use additional modules: hygestat_genes, hygestat_annotation, find_gene and the Matlab visualization procedure.
Hygestat_BLESS is the core part of the iSeq software that identifies regions statistically significantly enriched in DNA double stranded breaks using DSB sequencing data such as BLESS.
The software has been optimized and tested on the latest versions of Fedora (Fedora 24) and Kubuntu (Kubuntu 16.10). Please download the following files on the main page http://breakome.utmb.edu/software.html
